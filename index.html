        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Research Invitation</strong><br>
                My name is Olasunkanmi Mujib Oso, and I am a MSc Data Science student. You are cordially invited to participate in my final year project, "What makes an effective data visualisation?" My research focuses on how to provide data visualisations in an effective manner.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Reason for Invite</strong><br>
                You have been chosen as I am looking to recruit healthy participants, particularly aged 18-65 years who are familiar with numbers in tables and charts. To create excellent data visualisations, I have specifically chosen this demographic.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Am I Required to Participate?</strong><br>
                Participation is voluntary. To confirm that you are willing to participate, we will need you to sign a consent form. You may leave at any time without giving a reason.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>What Will I Need to Do?</strong><br>
                The project will last 3 months, and as part of this project, participants will be requested to complete a demographic questionnaire, including fundamental details such as age, gender, and their responses to questions about visualization as part of this experiment. Participants will be given a consent form to complete before any data is gathered that will detail their consent to participate, right to withdraw at any time (without cause), and understanding of the research's basic tenets.
            </li>

            <li>
             <strong>Are there any risks if I participate? </strong><br>

             </li>

            <li>
             <strong>Are there any advantages if I participate? </strong><br>
             Yes, participant will contribute to knowledge and research development in the field of visualisation. Also, a token will be given as incentive for time taken to take part in the research.
            </li>
